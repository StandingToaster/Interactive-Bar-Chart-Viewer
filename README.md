## Notes for Markers
- Bar selection clears when you click anywhere outside a bar (including when choosing a new dataset button).
- Zero-height bars still respond to clicks because the hit test uses a small tolerance around the axis.
- Flick left loads the previous dataset; flick right loads the next dataset.
- Used GenAI assistance to wire the custom flick translator into the SimpleKit event system.
